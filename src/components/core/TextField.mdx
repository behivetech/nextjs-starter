TextField is an extension of the [RMWC Component: TextField](https://rmwc.io/text-fields), on [Github](https://github.com/jamesmfriedman/rmwc/tree/master/src/textfield). This component will take any of the valid props an input element will take such as type, placeholder, onChange, etc. even though they aren't listed here. All props passed in go into the `<input />` element. If you need props to go into the root element, pass in the rootProps prop as an object. The className prop will also go into the root element.

No preview available on this one. Need to figure out some weird hook error for useState.
