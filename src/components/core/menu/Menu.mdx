This is a [RMWC Component(s): Menu](https://rmwc.io/menus), on [Github](https://github.com/jamesmfriedman/rmwc/tree/master/src/menu).You can compose a menu with the given components, and manually manage the open state. Menu expects MenuItems as children while MenuSurface is a generic container which can have anything as a child.

Components to be use with the Menu component are SimpleMenu, MenuSurfaceAnchor, MenuSurface, SimpleMenuSurface, MenuItem, MenuLink...

The MenuLink uses a component core Link component which will use the gatsby Link component if
the `to` prop is set or a regular `<a />` element if the `href` prop is set. It has some specail
styling on it which will make click event of the element fill the entire space of the MenuItem component which makes it more a11y and device compliant.

```js live=true
<div>
    <SimpleMenu handle={<Button>Simple Menu</Button>}>
        <MenuItem>Cookies</MenuItem>
        <MenuItem>Pizza</MenuItem>
        <MenuItem>Icecream</MenuItem>
    </SimpleMenu>

    <SimpleMenuSurface handle={<Button>Simple Menu Surface</Button>}>
        <div style={{padding: '1rem'}}>Make the content whatever you want.</div>
    </SimpleMenuSurface>
</div>
```

More info and prop types and other ways to use these components can be found on the [RMWC Component page for Menu](https://rmwc.io/menus).
