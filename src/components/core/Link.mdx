This component will switch between an `<a />` tag and [Gatsby's Link component](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-link/). Any url's within this site should use the `to` prop with a relative path set. All external links should use the `href` prop. All other props not listed here will be passed down to the `<a />` tag or the Gatsby Link component.
